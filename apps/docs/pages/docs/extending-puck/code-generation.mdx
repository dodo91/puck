# Code generation

Puck now includes a helper for exporting visual layouts as code. This makes it easy to ship editable experiences while still producing hand-off ready React components—similar to the goals of projects such as [`ui-builder`](https://github.com/olliethedev/ui-builder).

## `generateReactComponent`

Use [`generateReactComponent`](https://github.com/puckeditor/puck/blob/main/packages/core/lib/codegen/generate-react.ts) when you want to convert a Puck data payload into a React component:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { generateReactComponent } from "@measured/puck";
import type { Config } from "@measured/puck";

const config: Config = { /* ...the same config you pass to <Puck> */ };
const data = { /* ...stored page data */ };

const { code } = generateReactComponent({
  config,
  data,
  componentName: "LandingPage",
});

console.log(code);
```

The helper returns a string that contains an exported React component. By default it renders the exact components defined in your `config` and includes a React import. This is enough when your runtime environment already has those components available.

## Mapping to design system components

Often you will want to export a component tree that maps Puck blocks to another library (for example Ant Design, Radix, or your own design system). The `components` option lets you do that:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const { code } = generateReactComponent({
  config,
  data,
  componentName: "LandingPage",
  components: {
    Hero: {
      as: "MarketingHero",
      import: { path: "@/ui/marketing", default: "MarketingHero" },
      mapProps: ({ title, description, buttons }) => ({
        heading: title,
        body: description,
        actions: buttons,
      }),
    },
    ButtonBlock: {
      as: "Button",
      import: { path: "antd", import: "Button" },
      mapProps: ({ label, type }) => ({ children: label, type }),
    },
  },
});
```

Each entry lets you:

- **Rename the rendered component** via `as`.
- **Control import statements** via the `import` option. Use `{ path: "package", import: "Component" }` for named imports and `{ path: "package", default: "Component" }` for default imports.
- **Transform props** via `mapProps`, which receives the props stored in Puck's data model.
- **Rename slot props** via `slotProps`. For example, `{ content: "children" }` renders slot content as actual React children.

## Controlling the output

Additional flags give you control over what the helper produces:

- `componentName` — sets the exported function name.
- `includeIds` — include the Puck `id` prop on every component (useful if you rely on it in your runtime).
- `reactImport` — disable the default `import React from "react";` line when you are using the automatic JSX runtime.

The generated string is valid JSX. If you want to keep it consistent with the rest of your repository, run it through your formatter before checking it in:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import prettier from "prettier/standalone";
import parserBabel from "prettier/parser-babel";

const formatted = prettier.format(code, {
  parser: "babel",
  plugins: [parserBabel],
});
```

## Putting it together

Pairing `generateReactComponent` with an integration such as [Ant Design](/docs/integrating-puck/ant-design) lets your editor build a page visually and export the code straight into your existing component library.
